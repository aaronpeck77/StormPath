# Brain thinking log

Scratchpad for ideas we keep chewing on while other work is in progress. **Not a build queue.** Do not implement from this file. Promote a thought into `docs/BRAIN.md` if it changes the parked design; leave drive-by notes here.

**Rules:** Dated entries. One idea per block. If it would take more than a paragraph, you are designing the feature — stop. No commits required for a thought, but do not sneak code in “while thinking.”

## P3 — Interstate / freeway jam bypass

### 2026-09-12 — First chew (Bill: this is what sells interstate travel)

The hours-long standstill is almost never “you are at the wreck.” It is **you entered the back of the queue** while the cause is still miles ahead. Our old window is “2 miles before the incident pin.” That pin is often the **cause**, not the **tail**. If the queue already backs up past the last good interchange, a surgical hop from the wreck pin is too late.

When we build this, the first hard problem is **find the tail of the slowdown on the locked interstate**, then ask: is there still an exit *before* that tail? If no, do not offer a bypass — just tell the truth (“you are already in it”). If yes, the product moment is one voice line with a number: last easy exit, minutes it might save. That is what people will pay for.

Mapbox already gives duration / congestion along the line. Core (P1) must **accept** the hop as the live route. A web polyline swap that Core “fixes” back onto the jam is the last fight all over again. Offline download (P2) will not have live traffic — this feature needs cell, and the UI should say so.

Do not auto-take until that hop is boring: right exit, not a farm loop, on-ramp past the cause. Warn + one tap first.

## P2 — Download this trip

*(empty — add a note when corridor cache / Core TileStore work teaches us something)*

## P1 — Native-feel Drive

### 2026-09-12 — Stop after Go

Core must go idle and drop the NavigationMapView **before** the web trip is wiped. Nilling `MapboxNavigationProvider` while the map is still subscribed (or while `setToIdle` is in flight) is a hard crash. Same rule when P3 later installs a hop: never swap the web line while Core is still the live session.

### 2026-09-13 — Rt edge strip + linger Core

Rt is puck + dest on a thin rim, then zoom-in as remaining shortens. Stop still needs the provider to linger after `setToIdle` — same-turn release was the crash. Do not start a credit-burning think loop.
